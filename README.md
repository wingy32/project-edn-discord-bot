# project-edn-discord-bot

In the discord portal create a new application.

Name your application and then from the side menu, go to the bot page.

Create a bot, and then copy the token.

Create a `.env` file following the `.env.example` file.

Place your bot token inside the `.env` file, and also add the domain your exteel server is running on (provided you have the correct version that provides the api this bot expects(I may upload fork soon or update this repo for a standardised api))

Run the discord bot with `node index.js`
